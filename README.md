# Artificial-Intelligence-synthesizes-Logos

Get Artificial Intelligence to synthesize logos at much greater resolution and detail than before. A brilliant work by researchers at @MaastrichtU

The system builds on the popular StyleGAN architecture in order to control the output of logo generation and comes as an upgrade to LoGAN, a logo-crafting machine learning system.

Unlike the new and improved algorithm, LoGAN could only create new designs if provided one of a dozen colour keywords. For advertising/creative agencies, this will provide inspiration and reduce the number of design iterations undergone with clients.
